Hey! Call me Loki.

Check out my other website [here](https://lohchness.vercel.app)!

I'm studying BSc Computing and Software Systems at University of Melbourne, and I'm going to graduate in Sem 1 2024.

Some things about me:

 - I like doodling, reading, and long-distance running.
 - I can make a mean barbeque brisket.


I mess around with code after I realized that I've reached the point where I can do pretty much anything with the skills I have.
