## Diascrya

The Diascrya language is a [conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) I developed from 2020-2022, working on and off until I had settled on appearance and style. 

It is a decorative script designed by the Vigilant Haruspex, and is a scholarly, formal language that is rarely used outside of important legal documents. It is designed to be more beautiful than functional, and the symmetry of the words, characters, and overall structure acts as a measure of importance - the most symmetrical of writings are reserved for only the holiest of officials. It is intentionally obtuse - the more strokes there are on characters, the more complicated it becomes. It is hard for people to understand, and there are nonsense words thrown in. The distinct strokes of some characters have a slight-back swing. It is read left to right, top to bottom. 

A poem, written for a low-level document signified by the symmetrical structure, likely a notice or an agreement.
